Once upon a time in a faraway land there was a magic fairy named Henry. Henry, despite his shimmering wings and potent spells, was terrible at remembering birthdays. And on this particular day it happened to be the birthday of his very bestest friend in the world. He racked his brain, trying to recall what gift Princess Lily had specifically requested, but all he could remember was something about a sparkly rock.
