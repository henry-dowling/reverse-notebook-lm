# How to Be a Heartbreaker

**Verse 1**  
I’m a heartbreaker, dream maker  
I’m a heartbreaker, dream maker  

**Chorus**  
Rule number one is that you gotta have fun  
But baby, when you’re done, you gotta be the first to run  
Rule number two, just don’t get attached to  
Somebody you could lose  

**Verse 2**  
So let’s go, let’s go, let’s go  
And I’ll show you how to break hearts  
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go  
And I’ll show you how to break hearts  

**Chorus**  
Rule number one is that you gotta have fun  
But baby, when you’re done, you gotta be the first to run  
Rule number two, just don’t get attached to  
Somebody you could lose  

**Bridge**  
I’m a heartbreaker, dream maker  
I’m a heartbreaker, dream maker  

**Chorus**  
Rule number one is that you gotta have fun  
But baby, when you’re done, you gotta be the first to run  
Rule number two, just don’t get attached to  
Somebody you could lose  

**Outro**  
I’m a heartbreaker, dream maker  
I’m a heartbreaker, dream maker
