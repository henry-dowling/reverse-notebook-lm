Empiricism, or the practice of learning from historical patterns, has long been a cornerstone of economic forecasting. In contrast, first principles reasoning—where predictions are made based on fundamental truths—often leads to misguided conclusions. This essay argues that empiricism is generally more reliable than first principles reasoning for predicting future economic trends, supported by historical examples where predictions based on first principles failed while historical patterns repeated themselves. Notable instances include the Great Depression of the 1930s, where economists relied on classical theories that underestimated the value of government intervention, and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, where investors ignored historical patterns of market corrections. The 2008 financial crisis further exemplifies this argument, as many experts assumed housing prices would rise indefinitely without recognizing the cyclical nature of the market.

Moreover, the recurring theme of economic cycles, such as the Kondratiev waves, highlights how history tends to repeat itself. These long-term economic cycles demonstrate that periods of growth are often followed by downturns, a pattern that has been observed throughout history. Those who ignore these cycles in favor of first principles reasoning often find themselves unprepared for the inevitable corrections. In conclusion, while first principles reasoning has its merits, it is often the historical patterns that provide a more reliable framework for predicting future economic trends. The examples of the Great Depression, the dot-com bubble, and the 2008 financial crisis illustrate the dangers of relying solely on theoretical reasoning. As history has shown time and again, understanding and learning from past patterns can lead to more accurate predictions and better decision-making in the realm of economics. This perspective aligns with the ideology that "nothing ever happens," emphasizing the importance of recognizing the cyclical nature of economic events and the lessons they impart.
